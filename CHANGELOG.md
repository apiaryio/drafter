# Drafter Changelog

## Master

### Breaking

* The following compiler versions are supported:

  * Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 or higher
  * GCC 5.3 or higher
  * Clang 4.0 or higher

### Enhancements

- Instead of returning int, functions that may error return `drafter_error`
  type. This adds additional type-safety when handling errors.

## 3.2.7

## Bug Fixes

* Fix JSON Schema for OneOf when required is present.
  [#453](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/453)

* Allow fixed-type when the nested type in array is six characters.
  [#463](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/463)

* Fix a few issues with codeblocks format.

## 3.2.6

### Bug Fixes

* Fix JSON Schema support for nullable with enums.
  [#455](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/455)

## 3.2.5

### Bug Fixes

* Action identifiers may now contain `(` and `)` characters.

  ```apib
  ## My Action (Deprecated) [GET]
  ```

## 3.2.4

### Bug Fixes

* Parameters values in API Elements are always serialized as API Element
  strings. This ensure consistency with API Blueprint AST and to prevent
  values being serialized differently. For example boolean of value `1` in API
  Blueprint AST would be treated as a string and therefore be serialized as
  `1`. However in API Elements it wouldn't be treated as truthy since `1` is
  not equal to `true` and would be serialized as `false`.

## 3.2.3

### Bug Fixes

* Prevent exposing duplicate parameters in API Elements output when a
  parameter is overshadowed.

* Fix support for escaped MSON-style parameters.
  [#445](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/445)

  Schemas.
  [#390](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/390)

## 2.3.1

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes a bug when a referenced mixin inherits another named type
  [#254](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/254)

* Some of the errors have been changed to warnings

* Fixes "One Of" JSON rendering. This fix does not include JSON schema
  for multiple `One of` definition in MSON object.
  [#288](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/288)


## 2.3.0

### Bug Fixes

* Parameters in Refract output will no longer contain a `content` value
  when there is no sample value.
  [#286](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/286)

  Data Structures.

## 2.3.0-pre.2

This release restores an API that caused a breaking change in the
previous pre-release 2.3.0-pre.1.

## 2.3.0-pre.1

### Bug Fixes

* It was causing lot of different problems like segmentation faults, stack
  overflows or even infinite loops depending on what error was ignored.
  [#269](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/269)

* Variable property name issues are fixed including correct generation
  of JSON Schema.

* Improved error reporting. Some of the semantic errors like circular
  references were issued without a sourcemap information, that is not
  the case anymore.

* `httpRequest` and `httpResponse` payloads now have source maps attached while
  using the Refract output.
  [#259](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter/issues/259)


## 2.3.0-pre.0

### Enhancements

* Partial implementation of
  [RFC 4: Request Parameters](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint-rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0004-request-parameters.md)

  of these parameters is not yet handled.

* Adds support for building Drafter with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

### Bug Fixes

* The content-type for JSON Schema messageBodySchema is now correctly
  `application/schema+json`.

  binding, allowing you to use Drafter JS and Protagonist
  with the same interface.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes a crash when handling circular references in MSON Mixins.
