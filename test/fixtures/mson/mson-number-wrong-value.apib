## User (object)

It is number type, but input is string, we will convert it into
Number Element, without content set.

FIXME: In the future, we should try to parse it, but it might be a problem 
because of localized input (decimal point, thousand separators, etc.)

## Properties
- some_number: Číslo (number)
